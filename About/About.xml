	<description>Add more letters to help better manage Biotech events. The new letters are:
[list]
[*]Send a letter when someone's genes have finished regrowing.
[*]Send a letter when a colonist or prisoner reaches romanceable age (16 biological age, hard-coded for now).
[*]Send a letter when someone's genes extracted by using the Gene Extractor. I don't know how to include the extracted genes info in the letter (using Harmony). Helps and pointers would be greatly appreciated!
[/list]

It can be safely added mid-game and should not conflict with any mods.

Options for each events are:
[list]
[*]Send letter.
[*]Pause the game.
[/list]

Cheers!
